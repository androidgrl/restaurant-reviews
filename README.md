# Restaurant Reviews App

## Overview
This app is a project for Udacity's FE nanodegree program meant to demonstrate proficiency in: responsive, accessible, and offline design principals.


## Operating Instructions
In order to run this app:
1. CD into the home directory and check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

2. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`, and look around for a bit to see what the current experience looks like.

## Dependencies
